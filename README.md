# NRG-Game-engine-lib
A kotlin multiplatform library compiled to JVM, JS and a windows DLL (also possible to enable IOS, MacOS and linux builds), containing a game engine logic based on negamax with alpha-beta pruning (solution typical for chess engines)

The engine library were extracted from my previous project, [game-server](https://github.com/pksokolowski/game-server), and is now maintained separately within this project.
Therefore the initial commit here starts where the original project left off with regard to the engine logic.
